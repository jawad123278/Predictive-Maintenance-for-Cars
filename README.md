# Predictive Maintenance for Cars

## Repository Structure
Your repository contains the following key files:

- **cars_hyundai.csv**  
  - This is the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.  
  - It likely contains vehicle details such as mileage, engine status, service history, and other parameters affecting maintenance.

- **app.py (Backend Application)**  
  - This is the main backend script, probably built using Flask.  
  - It loads the machine learning model (**model.pkl**), processes user inputs, and returns maintenance predictions.  
  - Handles communication between the frontend and backend.

- **index.html (Frontend - User Input Page)**  
  - The main webpage where users enter car details.  
  - Contains a form for users to input relevant data for prediction.  
  - Sends user input to **app.py** for processing.

- **predict.html (Frontend - Results Page)**  
  - Displays the predictive maintenance result after processing the userâ€™s input.  
  - Likely shows something like "Car requires maintenance soon" or "Car is in good condition."

- **model.pkl (Machine Learning Model)**  
  - A pre-trained machine learning model saved using Pickle (.pkl format).  
  - **app.py** loads this file to make predictions based on user input.  
  - The model is trained on **cars_hyundai.csv**.

- **README.md (Project Documentation)**  
  - Provides an overview of the project, its purpose, setup instructions, and usage details.

## How the Application Works

### Step 1: User Interaction
- The user accesses the **index.html** page.
- They enter details like mileage, service history, engine health, etc.
- The data is sent to the backend (**app.py**) for processing.

### Step 2: Backend Processing
- **app.py** receives the user input and pre-processes the data.
- The trained model (**model.pkl**) makes a prediction (maintenance needed or not).
- The result is sent back to the frontend.

### Step 3: Displaying the Prediction
- The **predict.html** page receives the result.
- It displays whether the car requires maintenance or is in good condition.

## How to Run the App

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Predictive-Maintenance-for-Cars.git
cd Predictive-Maintenance-for-Cars
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(If `requirements.txt` is missing, install Flask, Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Pickle manually.)

### Step 3: Run the Backend
Start the application using:

```bash
python app.py
```
This will start a local server (probably at http://127.0.0.1:5000/).

### Step 4: Open the Web App
- Open your browser and go to: **http://127.0.0.1:5000/**
- Enter vehicle details and submit the form.
- View the predictive maintenance result on **predict.html**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (backend programming)
- **Flask** (for the web server)
- **Scikit-Learn** (machine learning)
- **Pickle** (for saving/loading the ML model)
- **HTML/CSS** (frontend UI)

## Possible Enhancements
You can improve the project by:
âœ… Adding a feature selection step to improve model performance.  
âœ… Using a database (like SQLite or PostgreSQL) to store vehicle maintenance history.  
âœ… Creating a dashboard to visualize maintenance trends.  
âœ… Deploying the app online using Heroku or AWS.
